# Java-Stats-Library

Java-Stats-Library is a comprehensive repository offering a suite of statistical functions and utilities for data analysis and manipulation in Java programming. This library aims to provide developers with a robust toolkit for performing various statistical calculations with ease and efficiency.

## Overview

Java-Stats-Library integrates Lombok for streamlined code generation and leverages generics for flexibility and type safety. It provides a wide range of statistical functions, including mean, median, mode, geometric mean, harmonic mean, sorting algorithms, and more.

## Prerequisites

To use Java-Stats-Library, you need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- Apache Maven or Gradle for dependency management (optional)

## Installation

To include Java-Stats-Library in your project, add the following dependency to your project's build configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle):

```xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-stats-library</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy
// Gradle
implementation 'com.example:java-stats-library:1.0.0'
```

## Usage

Import the required classes from Java-Stats-Library into your Java files and utilize them to perform statistical calculations on your data.

```java
import com.example.statistics.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage of statistical functions
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Features

- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, geometric mean, harmonic mean, and more.
- Sorting: Efficient sorting algorithms for sorting numerical arrays.
- Data Manipulation: Analyze datasets, calculate statistical measures, and manipulate data for further analysis.
- Flexibility: Utilizes generics for flexibility, allowing developers to work with different types of numerical data.
- Lombok Integration: Seamless integration with Lombok for reducing boilerplate code and improving code readability.
